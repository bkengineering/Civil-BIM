## Introduction

BIM stands for Building Information Modeling. It is a digital representation of the physical and functional characteristics of a building or infrastructure. It deals with the creation of 3D models that contain all the necessary information about a building, including its geometry, materials, systems, and performance data. The courses offered under the Masters Certificate program in BIM introduce students to the principles and practices of arriving at a comprehensive view of the entire building lifecycle, from design and construction to operation and maintenance using BIM software. The courses train them also in using BIM based CAD tools to simulate and analyze different scenarios, optimize designs, and identify potential conflicts before construction begins.

## Scope of Course

The Master Certificate program trains students in popular BIM software such as AutoCAD, Revit Architecture, and Civil 3D with the overall objective of helping them make better-informed decisions, reduce errors and rework, and ultimately deliver better buildings and infrastructure. The key areas of training offered in the certificate programs are:

- Design and visualization with 3D models of buildings and structures
- Collaboration between various stakeholders in a construction project
- Estimation of project costs, tracking of changes, and monitoring the budget
- Planning and scheduling construction activities, project timelines
- Creation of detailed records of a building's components, equipment, materials, and systems

## Career Prospects / Job Roles

BIM professionals have a wide range of career opportunities in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industries as the requirement to create and maintain 3D models of buildings and structures using BIM software increases. Masters level certificate program in BIM can equip one to oversee the implementation of BIM processes and standards, and BIM workflows, thus ensuring the timely delivery of accurate and complete project models. Here are some career options for BIM professionals:

- BIM Manager
- BIM Coordinator
- BIM Modeler
- BIM Consultant
- BIM Trainer
- BIM Engineer
